I live in kimpo jangidong.
It takes me roughly fifteen minutes to get here by my car.
It's not far. 
I think It's really calm near my house. because there are no bar or pub.
It's a little bad but It's fine.  
there is a park front of my house. but I have never gone. because It's cold.  
the wether will be warm. I have to go the park.

How do you spend your free time?

I spend most of free time watching videos related to history.
I like learning about complex relationship with contries. I especially like war history. I often try to look for this kind of movies or dramas. 
actually, I have watched almost historical dramas in korea. 
but I don't now about history well. I have poor memory. 
I think It's good ability of mine. because whenever I watch a movie or drama, I feel like It's new.
